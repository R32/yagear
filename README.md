yet another gear manager
------

This is a very basic equipment set manager for WOW Classic Era,
and it's quite similar to the one offered by Blizzard in WotLK.

It **DOES NOT HAVE** any advanced features yet,
such as automatic switching after being out of combat or something else

It is still lightweight compared to the others,
All the code including the UI, totals less than 1,000 lines

## Usage

- Press `ALT` key to show the "flyout slots"

  **BEWARE** : Due to Blizzard's restrictions, Switching weapons in COMBAT is **NOT** allowed

- The set can be dragged onto the action bar or it can be used with the macro: `/equipset [options] setname`
